## WhatMe
The attached program mimics the chat pattern of a person using Natural Language Processing. A simple txt file of a chat between 2 people is fed into the program, and is then used as a training data for 2 seperate sub-programs namely, *Speak like Me* and *Respond Like Me*, making it easier for the user to let the bot do the talking while they can cater to something much more important.

The program uses Tensorflow v1.15

Two inputs are then fed to the functions of the script and results are shown with variable number of sentences chosen.

Novelty:
1. Not everyone has the time and resources for chatting to consumers/people all time. This program makes it easier for the user to be available all the time.
2. Businesses can setup this bot to sound like the manager/owner and not some kind of trained ChatBot.
3. People can upload their chat patterns and the program can mimic them entirely, thus people can get a feeling of talking to their loved ones even after they're gone.
